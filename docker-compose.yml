# A simple Docker Compose file to set up a PostgreSQL container for our quiz API.
#
# To use this file:
# 1. Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed.
# 2. Run `docker-compose up -d` in your terminal from the same directory as this file.
#    The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
# 3. The PostgreSQL server will be available on localhost at port 5432.
